    title: 【MileStone】Zero Milestone of "How does Douban Think"
---

<h4>
    Give deconstructions of douban’s source code published on GitHub.
</h4>

<p>
    At the beginning of our job, three projects need to be done.
</p>
<ui>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/douban/CaoE">CaoE</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/douban/douban-client">Douban-client</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/douban/dpark">Dpark</a></li>
</ui>

<br>
<p>
    Every project will be described in at least 3 parts, which are 'Knowledge About', 'Design  Structure' and 'Coding Skills'.
</p>
<p>
    And 'Knowledge About' part contains a short description of current project as well as the knowledge needs to be learned before  users understanding the project.
</p>
<p>
    However, 'Design Structure' will show the project’s structure, which maybe the heavy part for project.
</p>
<p>
    For the last part, we will choose some coding skills that we think they can make sense as article content.
</p>
